Installation prototype by Oskar Koli for the course Generative Media Coding @ Aalto Media Lab.

The interaction is done by having a Kinect on the other side of the projection sheet, which reads the depth changes when a person pushes the sheet. The depth data is then used as an input parameter to the visualization.
The visualization is also projected from the other side of the sheet.

Made with Openframeworks.
